## üì¶ Installation

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher.
- Webcam or camera device.
- NVIDIA GPU (optional, for CUDA acceleration).

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/visiondetect-pro.git
   cd visiondetect-pro
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Download YOLO model:
   - Place your YOLOv8 `.pt` file in the project directory.
   - Update the `model_path` variable in the code if necessary.

## ‚ñ∂ Usage

### Start the Application
```bash
python visiondetect_pro.py
```

### Configure Settings
- Select your camera from the **Camera Settings** tab.
- Adjust resolution, FPS, and camera properties.
- Load your YOLO model if not automatically loaded.
- Click **Start Inspection** to begin detection.

## ‚öô Configuration

### Camera Settings
- **Resolution**: Adjust based on performance needs.
- **FPS Target**: Set desired frames per second.
- **Camera Properties**: Fine-tune exposure, gain, etc.

### Model Settings
- **Confidence Threshold**: Control detection sensitivity (0.1‚Äì0.9).
- **IoU Threshold**: Adjust non-maximum suppression (0.1‚Äì0.9).
- **Max Detections**: Limit simultaneous detections (1‚Äì1000).
- **Class Filtering**: Focus detection on specific classes.

### Output Settings
- Enable or disable frame capture.
- Set save interval and image quality.
- Enable CSV logging of detections.

## üìà Performance Tips

### For Higher FPS:
- Lower the resolution.
- Enable frame skipping.
- Use half-precision (FP16) with GPU acceleration.

### For Better Accuracy:
- Adjust exposure and gain for optimal lighting.
- Fine-tune confidence and IoU thresholds.
- Filter relevant classes.

### For Stability:
- Close other apps using the camera.
- Ensure proper lighting.
- Verify camera drivers and backend support.
